gencodec.py
-----------

`gencodec.py` is a script originally included with the source code
distribution of Python 3.2. It converts mappings produced by CodecMapper to a
Python source code implementing the respective codec. Unless the version
included with Python 3.3 and later, the generated codecs still work with Python
3.1 to 3.2.

To download other versions of this tool, obtain the Python source code as
described in <https://www.python.org/downloads/source/> and browse the
`Tools/unicode` folder.
